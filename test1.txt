1.what is repository?and how is it diff from a branch?
ans: The definition of a repository is a place where things are stored for safe keeping, or where there is an ample supply of something, or a person or thing with a lot of information about something.

ans: Rebasing is a process to reapply commits on top of another base trip. it is used to apply a sequence of commits from distinct branches into a final commit.it is an alternative of git merge command.
Git merging combines sequences of commits into one unified history of commits. There are two main ways Git will merge: Fast Forward and Three way. Git can automatically merge commits unless there are changes that conflict in both commit sequences.

3.what is git squash?
ans: The squash is an excellent technique for group-specific changes before forwarding them to others. You can merge several commits into a single commit with the compelling interactive rebase command. 


4.What is git Stash, Pop and apply. The diff between these?
ans:The key difference between git stash pop and apply involves the stash history. When a developer uses the git stash apply command, the most recently saved stash overwrites files in the current working tree but leaves the stash history alone. In contrast, the pop command restores files but then deletes the applied stash
